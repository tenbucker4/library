A library page created using HTML, CSS and Javascript! Users are able to add their book information to a form (title, author, pages and read/unread) and add them to a virtual bookshelf. Once added to the bookshelf, users have the option of toggling the read status of each book and deleting them from the bookshelf.

This project allowed me to practice combining CSS Grid and Flexbox, DOM element creation/manipulation, and JS object/constructors. I also learned how to store objects to localStorage to retain stored data upon reloading the page.
